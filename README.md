# Edge-case Tests

## Description

These tests are just there to handle edge cases like huge unions or deeply nested structures. As seen in the results `tsgo` is way faster in almost all cases.

## How are they run?

###Â Hardware

Macbook Pro M2, 16GB RAM, 10 Cores

### Configuration

I run `tsc` with the `--diagnostics` flag to also gather information about the memory used. `tsgo` is ran using the built binary from `hereby build` from the typescript-go repository.

## Test Descriptions

## Run tests yourself

1. Install typescript-go: https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-build-and-run
2. alias tsgo to the path of the /built/local/tsgo binary
3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   (cd DIR_PATH && tsgo && tsgo --singleThreaded && tsc --diagnostics);
   ```
